Rubber ducks might seem trivial, but they hold a special place in every programmer’s heart.
Explaining your code (or bugs) out loud to a silent duck can work miracles,
helping you clarify your thoughts and find hidden mistakes.

Why does it matter? Because sometimes the simplest solution is just an “outside perspective,”
even if it’s a small plastic duck. Rubber duck debugging is about walking through your logic step by step,
revealing insights you might otherwise miss.

Apply the same principle to RustasticDrone’s logs:
examine every line as if you’re explaining it to a duck, and watch how quickly
you spot any missteps. Combine Rust’s safety guarantees with a friendly rubber duck,
and you’ve got a debugging combo that’s downright quacktastic!
