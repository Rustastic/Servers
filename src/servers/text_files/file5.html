Remember how Mario hops across platforms, stomps on Goombas, and braves every challenge
to save Princess Peach? That same sense of heroism lives in Rust’s approach

Whether it’s collecting mushrooms to gain extra power or using Rust’s ownership model
to prevent memory leaks, each step is a power-up on your coding journey.
